### **Title**: CRUD operations on Employee using Entity Framework core.
### **Description**:
This project involves performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Employee using the .NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. The project is designed to allow users to manage employee information easily and efficiently.
The project has a user interface that is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface is designed to allow users to interact with the employee information stored in the database. The interface provides users with a form to add new employees to the database, a table to view existing employees, a form to edit existing employees, and a delete button to remove employees from the database.
### **Approach**:
The project is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application's concerns into three main components: the model, which represents the data and business logic; the view, which represents the user interface; and the controller, which handles user input and manages communication between the model and view.
The project has a database that stores information about the employee. The database is connected to the .NET MVC framework using Entity Framework. This allows the framework to access the database and perform the CRUD operations.

### **Features**:
```
Index Page: The Index page of the application displays a list of all employees in the database, along with options to add, update and delete employee.
Add employee Page: The AddNewemployee operation allows users to add new employees to the database. Users can enter the employee name, City, State, Salary and other details into a form. When the user clicks the submit button, the employee information is sent to the server, and a new employee record is created in the database.
UpdateEmployee Page: The UpdateEmployee operation allows users to modify existing employees in the database. Users can select a employee from the table and click the edit button. This opens a form where the user can modify the employee information. When the user click the submit button, the employee record in the database is updated with the new information.
Delete Functionality: The DeleteEmployee operation allows users to remove employees from the database. Users can click on a delete employee button to delete a Employee from the database.
